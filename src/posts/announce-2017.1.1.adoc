=== What's New?

* @Service and ServiceClient package change
* Lots of bugfixes
* Start of a http://howto.wildfly-swarm.io/[HOWTO]

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.

== @Service and ServiceClient package change

As part of some code restructuring of the JAX-RS enhanced client API, the packages that `@Service` and `ServiceClient` are within changed.

Both classes moved from `org.wildfly.swarm.cdi.jaxrsapi` to `org.wildfly.swarm.client.jaxrs`.

Be sure to update your application code with the change!
