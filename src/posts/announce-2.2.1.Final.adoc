== Thorntail 2.2.1.Final

Winter is coming, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, but we can stay warm with another Thorntail release! Say "hello" to Thorntail 2.2.1.Final!

=== What's New?

For those of you who like to start your app from the IDE, this release brings a brand new Thorntail Runner.
To use it, just add the `io.thorntail:thorntail-runner:2.2.1.Final` dependency to your `pom.xml` and run the `Runner` class from your IDE.
Please note that only `war` packaging is supported. The `Runner` class javadoc describes the available system properties to configure the execution.

This release also contains several bugfixes from different areas of the product, such as MicroProfile Config, MicroProfile RestClient or the `topology-openshift` fraction.

Two new HowTos have been added: how to expose application metrics using MicroProfile Metrics and Prometheus, and how to do distributed tracing with MicroProfile OpenTracing and Jaeger.

There were other improvements around dependencies in some fractions.

== @CreateSwarm is deprecated

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

`@CreateSwarm` annotation is now deprecated and shouldn't be used anymore.

== Config keys breaking changes

*WARNING: Breaking changes!*

As an additional task on renaming from WildFly Swarm to Thorntail, all configuration keys had been renamed from `swarm.x.y` to `thorntail.x.y`. 
The configuration system will still accept the old `swarm` names.
However, the old `swarm` prefix no longer works for certain system properties.
See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/THORN-2205[THORN-2205] for more details.
It is recommended to change all occurences of `-Dswarm.*` in all Thorntail invocations, including the Thorntail Maven plugin, to `-Dthorntail.*`
