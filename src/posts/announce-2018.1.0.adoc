== WildFly Swarm 2018.1.0

Ringing in the New Year with some minor fixes!

=== What's New?

* Eclipse MicroProfile updates
* Keycloak Server fixed
* JPA ignoring JNDI name for DataSource

++++
<!-- more -->

== Eclipse MicroProfile updates

On the road towards implementing Eclipse MicroProfile 1.3,
we now include Metrics 1.1 and Config 1.2 as the default implementation versions for these specifications.

== Keycloak Server fixed

2017.12.1 had a major problem in that the Keycloak Server wouldn't even start!
Big oops on our part there.

With this release that problem is resolved and it starts as before and works well.
Just remember this server is now based on Keycloak 3.4.0.Final.

== JPA ignoring JNDI name for DataSource

Previously if you created a custom JNDI name for a DataSource it would be ignored,
as it was expected to match the pattern of `java:jboss/datasources/${dsName}`.

Thanks to Sam McCollum in the community for providing the fix enabling custom JNDI names!
