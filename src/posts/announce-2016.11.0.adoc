== November means the release of 2016.11.0!

Celebrating National Pepper Month, at least for some nations,
we're happy to announce the release of WildFly Swarm version
2016.11.0.

=== What's New?

* Enhanced JAX-RS client library
* Support for Flyway schema migration for relational databases
* Improved Arquillian testing (still in progress)

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WIldFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, _Jolokia_ or _NetflixOSS Ribbon_.

== JAX-RS Client

If you're developing with JAX-RS and CDI we've just made it a lot easier to call external services!

Say we want to call an external service that returns the time.
We can define an interface that maps onto the method we want to call, such as:

[source,java]
----
@Path("time")
@Service(baseUrl = "http://localhost:8080/")
public interface TimeService extends ServiceClient<TimeService> {
    @GET
    @Path("default")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    String getTime();
}
----

We specify `@Service` with the url of the service.
In future enhancements we will integrate this annotation with our topology for service discovery.

We can then `@Inject` an instance of the service and call it as if it was a local method:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/messages")
@ApplicationScoped
public class MessageResource {
    @Inject
    TimeService timeService;

    @GET
    @Path("/sync")
    public String getMessageSync() throws Exception {
        return timeService.getTime();
    }
}
----

If we want the external call to be handled asynchronously we can do the following:

[source,java]
----
    @GET
    @Path("/async")
    public void getMessageAsync(@Suspended final AsyncResponse asyncResponse) throws Exception {
        timeService.exec(() -> timeService.getTime(),
                         s -> asyncResponse.resume(s),
                         asyncResponse::resume);
    }
----

We look forward to hearing your feedback on what we've currently done and what additional features you would like it to support.

== Flyway integration

Flyway is an open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration.
We've introduced a new `flyway` fraction that automatically executes your SQL scripts located in `src/main/resources/db/migration` when your microservice starts. Check this https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples/tree/2016.11.0/flyway[example] and read more about Flyway https://flywaydb.org/documentation/[here].

== Improved Arquillian

While we continue to improve our testing story with Arquillian, the biggest
visible change in this release the availability of `@DefaultDeployment` 
annotation.  This annotation may be applied at the _class_ level of your
test, and removes the need to provide a static method marked `@Deployment`
constructing your deployment.  It attempts to construct a reasonable default
deployment so that you don't have to.

== Gradle. Sigh.

We still include the Gradle plugin, but we disavow any knowledge about
it or expectation that it works. We've removed the Gradle examples
from the active build of our examples repository.  We have found that
Gradle does not consistently handle our tree of parent POMs and importation
of BOMs for version management.  We may completely remove Gradle support
in a future version, unless some Gradle-loving community member wants to
volunteer to knock it into shape. The core team is simply lacking the
resources to improve and maintain it.
