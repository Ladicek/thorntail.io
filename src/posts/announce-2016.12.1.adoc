== You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and then you have... version 2016.12.1.

To memorialize the passing of Alan Thicke, we are performing a mid-month release
of version 2016.12.1

=== What's New?

* Improvements on UberJar constructions and .war cleaning
* Improvements on fraction auto-detection
* Safely not enabling HTTP2 if no ciphers are strong enough
* Support `<resource-root>` in custom `module.xml`
* Fewer boot-time meaningless warnings
* Significantly better Windows support
* JavaDocs!

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.
