== WildFly Swarm 2017.6.0

In honor of National Doughnut Day, sink your teeth into
the 2017.6.0 release of WildFly Swarm.

=== What's New?

* More YAML less `main()`
* Update to WF Camel 4.7.0

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.

== More YAML less `main()`

In our continued efforts to remove custom `main()` usage,
we have two further improvements to help.

=== `@Configurable` support for Deployments

We've now made it possible for `@Configurable` to be applied to properties within
a deployment.

For now we've made these changes in the Swagger fraction,
but further fractions will come soon. So what do the changes mean?

Instead of needing a custom `main()` to do:

[source,java]
----
  archive.setResourcePackages("org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jaxrs.swagger");
----

it's now possible to use YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
  swarm:
    deployment:
      example-jaxrs-swagger.war:
        swagger:
          packages:
             - org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jaxrs.swagger
----

The full list of YAML configuration for Swagger can be found https://reference.wildfly-swarm.io/fractions/swagger.html[here].

=== Deploy Artifacts by GAV

We can now also deploy artifacts that are dependencies in `pom.xml` as well:

[source,yaml]
----
  swarm:
    deployment:
      net.java.xadisk:xadisk.rar:
----

In this case the version of the artifact is pulled in from the dependency entry in the `pom.xml`.
