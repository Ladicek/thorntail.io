== WildFly Swarm 2017.3.3

Since it's good to beware the ides of March, we're releasing 2017.3.3 a few days 
prior to it. Et tu, Brute?

=== What's New?

* Health API Changes (breaking)
* Fixing logging bugs introduced in 2017.3.2

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.

== Health API Changes

The health API moved from org.wildfly.swarm.monitor to org.wildfly.swarm.health.
Apologies for the changes, but we ran into a bug when health was used with the config-api.
To mitigate the problem, the health API had to be relocated into it's own module and package.
