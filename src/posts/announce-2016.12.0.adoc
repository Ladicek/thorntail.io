== It's December, WildFly Swarm 2016.12.0 swings in like a monkey.

Since December 14th is Monkey Day (look it up!), we're shipping
WildFly Swarm 2016.12.0 with a side-dish of bananas.  Bananas.

=== What's New?

* More configurability
* Bring-You-Own JDBC driver
* Improvements to the health/monitoring
* Improvements to OpenShift support
* Fluentd logging support

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WildFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, or _Jolokia_.

== More Configurability

Some time was spent to make everything more consistently configurable without 
requiring you to write your own `main(...)` method.  While we've supported
`project-stages.yml` and Java system properties for a while, the things that
were configurable using them was hit-or-miss.

Now, through `project-stages.yml` you can accomplish most any configuration
of fractions that would've normally required a `main(...)`.  When booting up
your application, you'll now see a rather verbose set of output, similar to:

[source]
----
...
swarm.management.http-interface-management-interface.socket-binding = management-http
swarm.management.http.port                                          = 9990
swarm.management.https.port                                         = 9993
swarm.request-controller.active-requests                            = (unset)
swarm.request-controller.max-requests                               = (unset)
swarm.request-controller.track-individual-endpoints                 = (unset)
swarm.undertow.alias                                                = (unset)
swarm.undertow.buffer-caches.default.buffer-size                    = (unset)
swarm.undertow.buffer-caches.default.buffers-per-region             = (unset)
...
----

We currently display all configurable items, even if unset.  If you have a
`main(...)` with customizations, those customizations will be visible during
boot.  For those of you who are security-minded, we also redact any configuration item
that might be a password.

The naming of the configuration items follows the structure of the
Fraction APIs you may have already been using to configure your application.
While these names are as dotted properties, and can be ultimately set
using `-Dkey=value` on the command-line, they also represent the
YAML tree you can use from within a `project-stages.yml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
swarm:
  management:
    http:
      port: 9990
    https:
      port: 9993
----

The general format is

[source,yaml]
----
swarm:
  fraction-name:
    # fraction attribute
    attribute-key: value
    # collection of subresources
    subresource-type:
      subresource-key:
        attribute-key: value
    # singleton subresource
    subresource-key:
      attribute-key: value
----

Additionally, you now use `project-stages.yml` not only to configure existing
components, but it may be used to create new configured components.  This is 
primarily thought to be useful for defining items such as datasources.

[source,yaml]
----
swarm:
  datasources:
    data-sources:
      MyDS:
        driver-name: myh2
        connection-url: jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
        user-name: sa
        password: sa
      MyOtherDS:
        driver-name: myh2
        connection-url: jdbc:h2:mem:other-test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
        user-name: sa
        password: sa

== Bring-your-own JDBC driver

*WARNING: Breaking change!*

Previously we provided Maven artifacts that transitively brought in particular
JDBC drivers to make it easier to integrate them with the underlying WildFly
datasources subsystem.  This was problematic due to the fact that we had to
select specific versions of a given driver and also couldn't support non-freely-available
drivers.

We have completely removed our DB driver fractions.  They are *gone*.  

You now get to bring your own JDBC driver.  In fact, you *must* bring your own
JDBC driver.  All that's required though is just adding it as a normal
Maven dependency to your project.

e.g.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.187</version>
</dependency>
----

That being said, we have replaced our own inclusion of specific versions
of specific drivers with enough logic to handle the setup of the WildFly
driver, the creation (at runtime) of the relevant `module.xml` to load it.

We now auto-detect the following database JDBC drivers and attempt to configure them
correctly:

- H2
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- EnterpriseDB
- Oracle
- SQLServer
- Sybase
- DB2

This includes noticing if you have a DB2 license `jar` because you're 
connecting to an AS/400 or whatnot. 

That being said, we haven't access to a few of the non-freely-available
databases, so we welcome reports of any issues discovered.

== Health checks

*WARNING: Breaking change!*

The health check API and protocol has been updated to make it easier to use. Unlike the prior version, `/health` now aggregates 
all checks and returns a combined response with a single outcome. You would still expose health checks using JAX-RS resources, but you only need to know `/health` as the entry point for clients to verify the liveliness of your node (i.e. kubernetes). Along these lines, we've removed `CompositeHealthStatus`, because that's implied by the former. 

Security has been simplified as well. It's now an all-or-nothing approach. If you define a security realm all endpoints will be secured, as such the attribute `inheritSecurity` on `@Health` has been removed. 

Checks now *require* an ID (or name) to identify them in composite responses. Hence the builder API on `HealthStatus` has been modified to reflect this. 

Taking everything into account, the wireformat has changed slightly as well. A regular response, now looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "data": {
                "freebytes": 35445936128
            },
            "id": "diskspace",
            "result": "UP"
        },
        {
            "data": {
                "date": "Fri Dec 02 09:50:12 CET 2016",
                "time": 1480668612010
            },
            "id": "something-else",
            "result": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "outcome": "UP"
}
