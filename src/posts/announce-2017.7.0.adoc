== WildFly Swarm 2017.7.0

In 1405 Chinese fleet commander Zheng He set sail to explore the world for the first time!

2017.7.0 is your chance to explore WildFly Swarm for the first time,
or explore it anew with fresh eyes!

=== What's New?

* YAML, YAML, and more YAML!
* Temp File location
* Component upgrades
* Gradle updates

=== YAML, YAML, and more YAML!

Bob McWhirter was feverishly improving all things YAML for this release!

It's now possible with YAML to:

* Configure socket-binding-groups and socket-bindings.
* Configure network interfaces
* Advertise a microservice to Ribbon

Along with fixing some issues with YAML processing for JASPIC modules,
and improving how configuration handles defaults across a group of configuration items.

=== Temp File location

WildFly Swarm explodes your uber jar into the temp directory at startup so that all classes are available on the classpath.
Previously those files ended up in whatever temp file location was specified by `java.io.tmpdir` or whatever the JVM chose.

That's fine most of the time, but if you have extremely long running processes, which is the point of microservices,
you want to be able to clean up any unimportant temp files from storage to keep a running system healthy!
Unfortunately, until now that also meant removing the files WildFly Swarm needed from under it.

With this release you can set `swarm.io.tmpdir` to be a more permanent temp directory for all jars and classes
extracted by WildFly Swarm. Ensuring that you or your operating system won't unintentionally remove them when a process
is using them.

=== Component upgrades

Keycloak was updated to 2.5.5.Final and Teiid to 9.3.0.Final.

=== Gradle updates

Thanks to Michael Fraefel we've seen some improvements in our Gradle support.

When using `gradle run` resources are now included in the default WAR deployment that WildFly Swarm generates.
